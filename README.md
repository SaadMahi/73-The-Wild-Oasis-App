# React Cabins Component

The provided code defines a React component named `Cabins` that utilizes the Supabase client to fetch cabin data from a Supabase database. The `getCabins` function is responsible for asynchronous data retrieval from the 'cabins' table. It logs the fetched data to the console and appropriately handles errors.

## Functionalities

- **Supabase Integration:**

  - The code includes an import statement for the Supabase client:
    ```javascript
    import supabase from './supabase';
    ```

- **Data Retrieval Function:**

  - The `getCabins` function asynchronously fetches data from the 'cabins' table in the Supabase database:
    ```javascript
    export async function getCabins() {
      // Code for data retrieval from Supabase
    }
    ```
    It ensures proper error handling and either returns the fetched data or throws an error if the data cannot be loaded.

- **React Component - Cabins:**

  - The `Cabins` component is a React functional component that employs the `useEffect` hook to fetch and log cabin data when the component mounts:

    ```javascript
    import { useEffect } from 'react';
    import Heading from '../ui/Heading';
    import Row from '../ui/Row';
    import { getCabins } from '../services/apiCabins';

    function Cabins() {
      // Code for component rendering and data fetching
    }

    export default Cabins;
    ```

    The component renders a heading indicating "All cabins," a test paragraph, and an image sourced from Supabase storage. The `useEffect` hook ensures the data-fetching process is triggered on component mount.

## Purpose

This code serves as a foundational structure for displaying and managing cabin data in a React application.
