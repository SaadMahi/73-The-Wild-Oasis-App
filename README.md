# React Application with Declarative Routes

The provided code is a React application that utilizes the `react-router-dom` library to set up declarative routes for different pages within the application. Here's a description of the code:

## App Component

The `App` component is the root component of the React application. It includes the following key components and functionalities:

- **GlobalStyles:** This component, imported from './styles/GlobalStyles', likely contains global CSS styles to be applied throughout the application.

- **React Router Setup:** The application uses the `react-router-dom` library for client-side routing. It has imported necessary components such as `BrowserRouter`, `Navigate`, `Route`, and `Routes` from 'react-router-dom'.

- **Routes Configuration:** Inside the `BrowserRouter`, the `<Routes>` component is used to define various routes for the application. Each `<Route>` component represents a specific page or view, and the `path` prop is used to define the route's URL.

- **Default Route:** The first `<Route>` with the `index` prop and `Navigate` element is set as the default route. If the user visits an unrecognized URL, they will be redirected to the 'dashboard' page. The `replace` prop is used to replace the URL in the history stack.

- **Individual Pages:** Following the default route, there are `<Route>` components for specific pages such as 'dashboard', 'account', 'bookings', 'cabins', 'login', 'settings', and 'users'. Each route is associated with a corresponding component (e.g., `<Dashboard />`, `<Account />`) to be rendered when the route is matched.

- **Wildcard Route:** The last `<Route>` with the `path='*'` prop is a wildcard route, which will be matched if none of the previous routes match the entered URL. It renders the `<PageNotFound />` component, indicating that the requested page does not exist.

- **GlobalStyles and BrowserRouter Wrappers:** The application includes a wrapper for global styles and wraps the entire route configuration with `<BrowserRouter>`.

Overall, this setup enables navigation within the React application based on the specified routes, and it ensures that users are directed to the appropriate page based on the URL they visit. The declarative approach simplifies the route configuration and enhances code readability.
