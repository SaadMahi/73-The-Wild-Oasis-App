# CreateCabinForm Component Description

This JavaScript file defines a React component named `CreateCabinForm` that utilizes the `react-hook-form` library to simplify form handling in a React Single Page Application (SPA). The form includes various input fields such as text, number, and file, along with corresponding labels and styling. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

## Dependencies:

The component imports necessary dependencies, including `styled-components` for styling, `react-hook-form` for form management, and various UI components (`Input`, `Form`, `Button`, `FileInput`, `Textarea`).

## Form Styling:

Styled components are used to define the styling for different parts of the form, such as `FormRow`, `Label`, and `Error`.

## Form Structure:

The form is structured using the `Form` component, and individual form rows (`FormRow`) are created for each input field.

## React Hook Form Integration:

- The `useForm` hook is employed to access the `register` and `handleSubmit` functions.
- The `register` function is used to register input fields, making them managed by `react-hook-form`. This eliminates the need for manual state management.
- Each input field is associated with a specific key (e.g., 'name', 'maxCapacity') through the spread operator (`{...register('fieldName')}`).

## Form Submission:

- The form's `onSubmit` function is defined using the `handleSubmit` function obtained from `useForm`.
- When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` function calls a custom `onSubmit` function, logging the data from all registered fields to the console.

## Form Fields:

Various input fields are included in the form, such as 'Cabin name', 'Maximum capacity', 'Regular price', 'Discount', 'Description for website', and 'Cabin photo'.
Each field is associated with a corresponding label, and appropriate input types and attributes are set.

## Button Actions:

The form includes 'Cancel' and 'Submit Cabin' buttons with associated actions. The 'Submit Cabin' button triggers the form submission, and the 'Cancel' button is of type 'reset'.

## File Input:

A file input field (`FileInput`) is included for uploading a cabin photo.

## Styling Details:

The styling includes grid layout for form rows, alignment adjustments, and border styling for separating form rows.
The last form row contains buttons and is flex-container styled with justified content.

Overall, this component is designed to create a user-friendly form for inputting cabin details, with streamlined form management provided by the `react-hook-form` library.
