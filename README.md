# Supabase Cabin Management

## Functionality Overview:

The code focuses on creating new cabins, retrieving cabin data, and deleting cabins from a Supabase database using the Supabase JavaScript library. It leverages the `useMutation()` hook from React Query for handling mutations.

## Detailed Description:

### 1. Create New Cabins (`createCabin` function):

- **Setting Up Policies:**

  - Describes the process of creating new policies for inserting and updating data in the Supabase database.
  - Mentions the steps for creating these policies, including selecting templates, setting operations, and saving policies.

- **API Documentation:**

  - Instructs to refer to the API documentation and copy the insert code for creating new cabins.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Advises adding error handling and data return methods for the new cabin data.
  - Specifies that the data structure matches the required shape for Supabase.

### 2. Use of `useMutation()` Hook:

- **Setup of `useMutation`:**

  - Explains the usage of the `useMutation()` hook for mutating data on the server.
  - Describes the returned object containing the `mutate` function and `isLoading` state.

- **Configure Mutation Function:**

  - Configures the `mutate` function with the `createCabin` function as the mutation function.
  - Defines `onSuccess` and `onError` handlers for handling success and error scenarios.

- **Handling Data Mutation:**
  - Explains the need to invalidate the cabins query after a mutation to ensure updated data is fetched.
  - Introduces the use of `useQueryClient()` for managing queries.

### 3. Finalizing the Process:

- **Implementation:**
  - Demonstrates how to use the `mutate` function and `isLoading` state to initiate the creation of a new cabin.
  - Concludes by stating that everything works smoothly, resembling magic.

## Functions:

### a. `createCabin(newCabin)`:

- Inserts a new cabin into the Supabase database and returns the resulting data.
- Includes error handling to log and throw an error if the operation is unsuccessful.

### b. `getCabins()`:

- Retrieves all cabins from the Supabase database and returns the data.
- Implements error handling similar to `createCabin()`.

### c. `deleteCabin(id)`:

- Deletes a cabin from the Supabase database based on the provided ID.
- Includes error handling for potential errors during the deletion process.
