This code snippet represents a React application using the React Router for navigation, React Query for managing state, and React Hot Toast for displaying notifications. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

### React Router Setup:

- Utilizes the `BrowserRouter` for handling client-side routing.
- Defines different routes using the `Routes` and `Route` components from `react-router-dom`.
- Sets up a default `AppLayout` that contains nested routes for various pages like Dashboard, Account, Bookings, Cabins, Settings, and Users.
- Includes a catch-all route for any undefined paths, redirecting to a `PageNotFound` component.
- Uses the `Navigate` component for redirection, ensuring the URL is replaced.

### Global Styles and Layout:

- Imports a `GlobalStyles` component, presumably for applying global CSS styles.
- Uses an `AppLayout` component as a common layout wrapper for nested routes.

### React Query Configuration:

- Initializes a `QueryClient` with default options, specifically setting `staleTime` to 0 to ensure data is always considered stale.

### React Query Devtools:

- Includes the `ReactQueryDevtools` component, initially set to be closed, for debugging and monitoring React Query state.

### React Hot Toast Integration:

- Adds the `Toaster` component from `react-hot-toast` to display notifications (toasts).
- Customizes the toast appearance and behavior using various props:
  - `position`: Sets the position of the toasts on the screen (top-center).
  - `gutter`: Controls the space between the toasts and the window (12 pixels).
  - `containerStyle`: Applies custom CSS styles to the toast container (margin of 8 pixels).
  - `toastOptions`: Configures specific options for success and error toasts, including duration and style.

### Error Handling with Toasts:

- Replaces traditional `alert` calls with the `toast` function from `react-hot-toast`.
- Demonstrates the usage of both success and error toasts.
- Provides an example (commented out) where intentionally introducing an error in the Supabase URL triggers an error toast.

Overall, this React application is structured with proper routing, state management using React Query, and enhanced user experience through the use of toast notifications for success and error messages.
