# React CabinTable Component

This code snippet is a React component named `CabinTable` that utilizes the React Query library to fetch and manage data from an API. The component is designed to display a table of cabin-related information and incorporates styled components for a visually appealing layout. Below is a description of the major components and functionalities within the code:

## React Query Integration:

- The component imports the `useQuery` hook from the `@tanstack/react-query` library to manage data fetching efficiently.
- The `getCabins` function from the `../../services/apiCabins` file is used as the query function to fetch cabin-related data.

## Styled Components:

- Custom styled components are defined using the `styled-components` library to create a visually appealing table layout.
- The `Table` component represents the overall container for the table, styled with borders, background color, and rounded corners.
- The `TableHeader` component represents the header of the table, with styled columns for different cabin attributes like name, capacity, price, and discount.

## Fetching and Displaying Data:

- The `useQuery` hook is used to fetch data, and the result (loading state, data, or error) is destructured for further use.
- The `Table` and `TableHeader` components are utilized to structure the HTML, and the data is mapped over to create `CabinRow` components for each cabin.
- The `isLoading` state is used to display a custom spinner while the data is being fetched.

## Date Handling:

- There's a comment suggesting the installation of the `date-fns` library to handle date calculations, although the actual usage of this library is not present in the provided code.

## Accessibility Improvement:

- The styled components are given roles such as `table` and `row` to enhance the accessibility of the HTML structure, indicating that these styled components should be treated as a table and row.

## Stale Data Handling:

- A comment mentions setting the `staleTime` property to 0 seconds using React Query. This means that the data will always be considered stale, triggering a refetch on every render. This can be useful when the data needs to be consistently updated.

Overall, this code provides a foundation for a dynamic and visually appealing cabin table component in a React application, with an emphasis on efficient data fetching and presentation.
