This code snippet is part of a React application that interacts with a Supabase database to fetch and delete cabin data. The focus is on using the React Query library to mutate the remote server state and automatically update the user interface.

### `getCabins` Function:

- This function uses the Supabase client to fetch data from the 'cabins' table.
- It utilizes the `select('*')` method to retrieve all columns.
- If there's an error during the fetch operation, an error is logged, and an exception is thrown.

### `deleteCabin` Function:

- This function is designed to delete a cabin from the 'cabins' table based on the provided ID.
- It uses the `delete()` method of the Supabase client and specifies the condition for deletion using `eq('id', id)`.
- Like the `getCabins` function, it handles errors by logging them and throwing an exception.

### Usage of React Query:

- The comments guide through the process of integrating React Query to delete a cabin.
- It introduces the `useMutation` hook, which is used to trigger mutations (e.g., deletion in this case).
- The `useMutation` hook takes an object with a mutation function, which, in this case, calls the `deleteCabin` function.
- The `onSuccess` callback is utilized to invalidate the cache, triggering a refetch of the data.
- The `useQueryClient` hook is introduced to get access to the query client instance, which is then used to manually invalidate the query.

### Additional Notes:

- The code mentions the necessity of creating a new Supabase policy to allow cabin deletion, indicating a temporary setup to permit everyone to delete.
- There's a note about the automatic refetching behavior of React Query, ensuring that data becomes stale upon returning to the tab.

This code provides a structured approach to handling data fetching and deletion, leveraging the power of React Query for efficient state management and UI updates in a React application integrated with a Supabase database.
